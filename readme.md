# Docker

## What is Micro-Service & Benefits
- The idea consists of splitting your application into a set of smaller, inter-connected services that are:
	- Independently Deployable	
	- Highly maintainable
	- Loosely coupled

## What is docker

- Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

## Why use docker

- Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere.
