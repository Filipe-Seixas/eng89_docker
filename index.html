  <h1>Filipe Silva</h1>
  <h2>Junior DevOps Consultant</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p> Filipeâ€™s interest in technology was fired by people around him, especially family members and the healthy rivalry that emerges leading growth. His university studies took him further, but he always recognised that close collaboration and teamwork was an important element of any technical endeavour. The importance of collaboration was a key factor in him volunteering as a student helper at university developing those essential interpersonal skills.</p>

  <p> While Filipe loves an organised environment, he relishes the challenge of more difficult and spontaneous situations. His ability to stay determined and keep a positive mindset when confronted by new challenges reveals he is a resilient and capable worker, always striving for quality.</p>

  <p> Filipe enjoys learning about new cultures and studying languages which led him to spend a week abroad in Shanghai as part of a university programme where he acquired new social skills, an understanding of the differences between cultures and how important they are to remember when working in a professional setting.</p>
